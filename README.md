The data can be found in data/counts. The data is both provided in total (full-data.RDS and full-data.csv) and on a per country basis ([countryname].csv).

The data are organized by country/month. Each country month contains the raw counts of identified event types for both civic space events and RAI events as well as normalized counts, which are the raw counts divided by article totals. Where appropriate, civic space data is broken into civic relevant and non-civic relevant.
