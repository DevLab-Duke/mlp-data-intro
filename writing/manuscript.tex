Civic space - the fundamental freedoms necessary for citizens to
influence politics - is under constant contestation. Despite the
importance of day-to-day contestation over these rights, there is very
little data allowing us to study the events and processes that
constitute this struggle. We introduce new data that captures civic
space activity across 65 developing countries from 2012 to 2024. Using
an original corpus of over 120 million articles from nearly 350
high-quality domestic media outlets and 30 international and regional
outlets, we use human-supervised web scraping and open-source
computational tools to track monthly variation in media attention across
20 civic space events. Our approach yields three achievements: first,
our corpus provides unprecedented coverage of reporting by developing
country media outlets, addressing biases in other media event data;
second, the resulting monthly event data set covers a wide range of new
civic space activities; and third, we demonstrate the utility of this
data for identifying and forecasting major political events and discuss
applications for research on regime dynamics during a time of democratic
backsliding.

\section{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In 2016, 3.5 billion people lived under autocracy; by 2021, this number
surged to over 5.4 billion (Boese-Schlosser et al. 2022). Concentrated
in the global south, this ``third wave of autocratization'' is
constricting civic space and limiting the ability of citizens to
advocate for better governance (Lührmann and Lindberg 2019; Waldner and
Lust 2018).\footnote{Following Brechenmacher and Carothers (2019), we
  define civic space as the fundamental freedoms that allow people to
  gather, communicate, and take part in groups to influence society and
  politics.} Nevertheless, citizens around the world continue to
challenge these authoritarian movements.

Despite the importance of this day-to-day push-and-pull over political
liberties and state control, data to study the events and processes that
constitute this struggle is limited. Existing measures of civic space
come largely from annual, expert-coded indicators classifying the nature
of political regimes (Coppedge et al. 2023; U.S. Agency for
International Development 2022; World Justice Project 2024). While these
regime indices have opened-up new domains of research to rigorous
investigation, they are not designed to provide insight into the
quotidian politics where battles over civic space take place.

This article introduces the Machine Learning for Peace (ML4P) dataset,
which provides monthly data on 20 civic space events across 66
developing countries from January 2012 through December 2024.
\emph{ML4P} measures civic space activity by capturing monthly variation
in levels of media attention across these civic events, providing a
dynamic view of where and when civic space events are happening and
their level of political salience. \emph{ML4P} represents a major
advance in our ability to understand civic space dynamics by providing a
higher-frequency measure of a broad range of events bearing on civic
space.

\emph{ML4P} is constructed from articles collected by the High-Quality
Media from Aid Receiving Countries (\emph{HQMARC}) corpus, an original
collection of articles scraped from 354 prominent \emph{domestic} media
outlets based across our sample of 66 countries and publishing in 36
languages. We supplement these domestic outlets with content scraped
from 12 regional and 15 global outlets (henceforth, we refer to regional
and global outlets collectively as ``international''). In sharp contrast
to many other sources of event data, more than 95\% of the articles in
\emph{HQMARC} are scraped from domestic media outlets based in the
countries covered by our dataset.

\emph{HQMARC} employs a human-supervised, source-specific scraping
methodology that prioritizes data quality and comprehensiveness over the
broad but shallow coverage typical of automated web crawlers. This
process proves particularly valuable for domestic news sources, whose
websites are less stable than international outlets. Our efforts yield
significant advantages over both ``big data'' media repositories like
GDELT, Internet Archive, and Common Crawl and expensive commercial
databases like Factive and LexisNexis, delivering a stable corpus
composition with superior linguistic diversity and coverage of
high-quality developing-country sources. However, \emph{HQMARC's} size
and linguistic diversity makes human classification prohibitively
expensive. To produce \emph{ML4P's} structured civic-space events data,
we use open-source tools to translate articles, extract information, and
tag each article's primary event and country.

This paper proceeds as follows. First, we discuss how \emph{ML4P}
complements existing data on regimes and opens new avenues for research.
Second, we describe the data production process and the advantages of
our approach. We compare the coverage of \emph{HQMARC} to other major
media repositories, showing superior accuracy and stability compared to
alternatives. Third, we present results from exploratory analyses and
validation exercises. We compare event coverage from international and
regional sources to that of domestic sources, finding systematic
differences in coverage and frequent omissions of significant events by
non-domestic sources. Our findings underscore the risk of relying on
data generated from predominantly international or regional media
outlets, a common practice in the social sciences. Next, we conduct an
AI-assisted qualitative audit of major events in six developing
countries and find that \emph{ML4P} event detections correspond to
real-world events, confirming its ability to identify true positives.
Finally, we assess false negatives by conducting a series of case
studies to identify major political events in recent years,
demonstrating that \emph{ML4P} consistently captures these major events.

Fourth, we provide a use case, documenting how civic space events are
predictive of independently measured instances of severe political
instability. We focus on predicting US State Department travel
advisories, which capture a broad range of security, health, and civic
threats, and show that several of \emph{ML4P's} measures of civic space
contribute important substantive insights. The final two sections review
\emph{ML4P's} limitations and explain why, despite them, it remains a
valuable resource for research on democratic backsliding, political
accountability and contentious politics, media behavior, crisis
response, and program evaluation.

\section{2. Democratic Erosion, Annual Indices, and the Need for Civic
Space Data}\label{sec-background}}

The ``third wave of autocratization'' has brought renewed attention to
the study of regime type, political transitions, and democratic
backsliding (Lührmann and Lindberg 2019). This attention has been
accompanied by a proliferation of measures of regime type, including the
Varieties of Democracy (VDEM) project (Coppedge et al. 2023), the Civil
Society Organization Sustainability Index (U.S. Agency for International
Development 2022) and the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index
(World Justice Project 2024), among many others. These indices are
designed to provide information about levels of democracy over time and
space and to capture distinct features of regimes, ranging from freedom
of the press, rule of law, the ease of civic organizing and beyond.
While V-Dem has improved the rigor of annual indices, such measures are
ill-suited to the everyday politics where civic-space battles unfold.

Ultimately, these annual changes in the nature of regimes are the result
of discrete actions at specific moments. Annual indices summarize their
cumulative effects over 12 months, blurring mechanisms and timing.
\emph{ML4P} complements these efforts by tracing high-frequency
civic-space events -- often unfolding over days or weeks -- that
aggregate into broader change. Hungary illustrates the point: the 2010
media law centralizing control, the 2011 court-packing constitutional
changes, the 2012 electoral law that gerrymandered districts, the 2017
targeting of Central European University, and the 2018 ``Stop Soros''
laws criminalizing aid to asylum seekers. Each mattered, yet annual
scores smooth over these discrete moments. \emph{ML4P} is designed to
reorient analysis toward the high-frequency civic-space events that
drive broader regime change.

Several existing event data projects produce high-quality data bearing
on civic space. Among the most notable are the Armed Conflict Location
Event Data Project (ACLED; Raleigh et al. (2010)), the Uppsala Conflict
Data Project Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED; Sundberg and
Melander (2013)), the Political Event Classification, Attributes, and
Types (POLECAT; Halterman et al. (2023)) dataset (formerly the
Integrated Crisis Early Warning System dataset; Boschee, Natarajan, and
Weischedel (2012)), and the Global Database of Events, Language, and
Tone (GDELT; Leetaru and Schrodt (2013)). While each of these datasets
have advanced social science research, each is limited in their ability
to drive research on civic space.

ACLED and UCDP are focused on violence and protest, and thus cover only
a modest, contentious slice of struggles over civic space. Neither
covers the legal changes, civic activism, press restrictions, corruption
or election irregularities that regularly rock civil society.
Alternatively, GDELT relies on the Conflict and Mediation Event
Observations (CAMEO) coding ontology and covers a broad range of events,
but it focuses on inter-state disputes and strategic interactions (P. A.
Schrodt, Gerner, and Yilmaz 2012), classifies events using a complex,
rigid system, and relies on limited and often dated actor dictionaries.
POLECAT relies on the powerful, flexible PLOVER ontology, but it too is
designed largely to capture inter-state and strategic international
interactions (Halterman et al. 2023).

\emph{ML4P} is the first event data source focused specifically on
events that bear on civic space. While we have a rich body of theory
about `regimes', the literature on `civic space' and `civil society' is
spread across varied bodies of work on protest, social capital, legal
studies, and election studies. Our solution is to collect data on a
broad range of events that expand, contract, or contest civic space. In
consultation with academic research and policy practitioners, we define
20 civic space event types, ranging from political arrests and
censorship to corruption, legal actions, and legal changes (see
Table~\ref{tbl-roberta} for a complete list of event categories). We
also code disasters and election activity -- episodes aspiring autocrats
often invoke to justify curbs on civil society. Although protests and
lethal violence are tracked elsewhere, \emph{ML4P} provides the first
systematic coverage of most other event types.

Together, these events provide a rich monthly portrait of civic-space
contestation and offer the potential for new research on regime
dynamics. By tracking 20 event types at monthly frequency across 66
countries, \emph{ML4P} enables analysis of both the outcomes of
democratic backsliding in new detail and the specific mechanisms and
temporal dynamics through which regimes change. Our approach also allows
researchers to measure the salience of different kinds of events in
domestic media and is flexible enough to quickly apply future changes to
coding criteria and/or add entirely new event types to the entire
corpus.

\hypertarget{sec-data}{%
\section{3. Constructing ML4P}\label{sec-data}}

Social scientists rely heavily on media reports to produce event data
(P. Schrodt and Yonamine 2013). While the shortcomings of this approach
are well documented (Daphi et al. 2025; Earl et al. 2004), monitoring
media reports remains the best means available to track the occurrence
of many events across a wide range of national contexts. Evidence
suggests that access to traditional media effectively increases citizen
knowledge of major events and government behavior, even in repressive
political environments (Besley and Burgess 2002; Arendt 2024). While
platforms like radio and social media are important, they often rely on
content originally produced by traditional news outlets (Quartey et al.
2023; Study of Journalism 2019), which are generally more trusted
(Fotopoulos 2023; Bridges 2019) and provide more comprehensive coverage
of political events (Lee, Diehl, and Valenzuela 2022; Schäfer and
Schemer 2024).

Efforts to create event data from media have long faced two obstacles:
(1) extracting information from unstructured text required
language-fluent human coders, limiting scale and introducing lags; and
(2) manual coding made revisions costly, since backward-compatible
updates required re-coding prior articles (ACLED 2023). Recent
machine-learning advances now enable fast, low-cost, and accurate
automated coding. While debates over human vs.~machine accuracy persist,
many studies report performance on par with -- or better than -- human
coders across domains (Tarr, Hwang, and Imai 2023; Brandt et al. 2024;
Halterman and Keith 2024; Halterman et al. 2023; Mueller and Rauh 2018).

Second, building reliable, high-quality media repositories is hard and
remain extremely rare. Many prominent political event datasets rely
heavily on data sourced from international and regional rather than
country-specific domestic sources, yielding limited linguistic diversity
(Raleigh, Kishi, and Linke 2023). Sourcing often runs through private
aggregators (Factiva, Lexis Nexis) with opaque rules for source
selection and relevance. For example, POLECAT uses Factiva to pull
politically relevant stories from 1,000+ outlets but in only seven
languages and without human curation (Halterman et al. 2023). In our
audit of the Lexis Nexis University archive, six \emph{ML4P} countries
have zero local outlets; where local outlets exist, they span 17
languages versus \emph{ML4P's} 34. As shown in Section 6, international
and regional outlets systematically emphasize different event types than
domestic media covering the same country.

Alternatively, ``big data'' repositories (GDELT, Internet Archive,
Common Crawl) use automated crawlers to ingest news from vast,
linguistically diverse sources but fail to consistently capture and
archive many key outlets. For example, GDELT's source list shifts
continually, with new sources added absent human oversight, producing
unstable coverage (Raleigh, Kishi, and Linke 2023). In
Section~\ref{sec-validation}, we show these indiscriminate crawls
retrieve only a fraction of articles from most outlets; even combined,
they sparsely cover prominent domestic media in developing countries.
General scrapers and parsers also introduce widespread metadata errors,
including incorrect publication dates.

ACLED stands alone in maintaining human review of sources while
achieving broad coverage, employing more than 200 local human
researchers to monitor more than 13,600 sources in over 100 languages.
Still, because each outlet is manually scanned, many articles are likely
never reviewed. By contrast, UCDP discloses little about source counts
or languages, but relies primarily on human monitoring of aggregator
feeds such as Lexis Nexis (Raleigh, Kishi, and Linke 2023).

Importantly, none of the existing datasets and repositories allow
researchers to understand how coverage of events relate to the broader
media environment -- an important gap, since dynamics in media salience
shape citizen beliefs and attitudes (Djerf-Pierre, Shehata, and
Johansson 2025). Projects that rely on aggregators (POLECAT, UCDP) or
human monitoring (ACLED) retain only ``relevant'' articles, so they
reveal whether an event occurred but not its salience relative to other
news. Crawler-based corpora also rarely capture all articles from target
outlets, preventing researchers from estimating how much attention
sources devote to specific events versus competing topics.\footnote{Additionally,
  crawler-based repositories, researchers cannot tell why some pieces
  from the same source are included while others are omitted.}

Although the scale of crawler-based repositories is appealing, for
researchers looking to report large samples and broad coverage, they add
and drop sources with little transparency. Adding or dropping sources
introduces the possibility that trends in the volume of reporting
dedicated to specific events are artifacts of changes in source material
rather than true changes in the frequency or salience of these events.
Private aggregators face similar volatility due to licensing changes
that researchers rarely observe. ACLED acknowledges this challenge and
mitigates it by adding new sources only when resources allow full
back-coding of their archives to match existing temporal
coverage.\footnote{ACLED's documentation notes that ``\ldots{} the
  addition of such a source in an ad hoc fashion risks the integrity of
  historical trends as it will introduce an `artificial spike' in the
  data. This refers to the phenomenon where if that same source was
  first back-coded before being introduced into the data, the `spike'
  that its inclusion introduces in the data would be gone (or minimized)
  --- suggesting that the spike does not reflect a `true spike' in
  disorder on the ground'' (ACLED 2023).}

To address these issues, \emph{ML4P} combines recent advances in
automated text analysis with \emph{HQMARC's} curated corpus of news
scraped from high-quality domestic outlets. The core of \emph{HQMARC's}
approach is to identify a curated list of critical domestic sources for
each country and then design a customized harvesting workflow that can
achieve comprehensive capture of everything published by those sources.
This targeted ``medium data'' approach enables comprehensive capture
from each source, allowing researchers to calculate the share of all
articles published by a given source that were covering a specific type
of event. Critically, \emph{HQMARC's} human-supervised scraping results
in a corpus with a more stable, well-understood composition than the
widely-used alternatives. As a result, this corpus can be used to
measure the salience of topics or events in a source's coverage at any
given moment.

This process ensures that we capture a broad range of high-quality media
from countries that often go underreported in the international press.
The result is a highly flexible research infrastructure that balances
breadth of coverage, source quality, and processing scalability.
Figure~\ref{fig-mermaid} provides a graphic representation of the
\emph{ML4P} data production pipeline. In the remainder of this section,
we describe each step in the pipeline.

\subsection{Building the HQMARC
Corpus}\label{building-the-hqmarc-corpus}}

\emph{ML4P} is constructed by processing articles from the \emph{HQMARC}
corpus. A key advantage of \emph{HQMARC} is its unprecedented accuracy
and granularity in capturing the publication history of critical
domestic media outlets. To overcome the composition challenges discussed
above, we developed a data-collection infrastructure designed to (1)
comprehensively capture local sources' full publication history and (2)
maintain accurate metadata. This process involves three main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Identify High-Quality Local News Sources:} We begin by
  compiling a list of local news sources with machine-scrapable
  websites. We consult publicly available directories of each country's
  media market (e.g., university library guides, Reporters Without
  Borders) as well as partners working in international NGOs, USAID
  country offices, and local civil society organizations to identify
  reputable publications that produce and publish original news content.
  We conduct a detailed desk review of each source's partisan
  affiliation by consulting reports on media ownership and press freedom
  in the outlet's country (see Appendix A Section 4). In very repressive
  countries, we occasionally include newspapers based outside their home
  countries if they remain a leading voice on domestic affairs. For
  example, we include \emph{El Faro}, a Salvadoran independent media
  outlet that relocated its headquarters to Costa Rica due to government
  persecution.

  From this initial list, we select newspapers whose online archives
  extend as far back as possible, preferably to 2012. We aim for at
  least 3--5 local sources per country, collectively yielding several
  thousand articles per month. In cases where a source's publication
  volume declines drastically or ceases entirely, we follow standardized
  replacement procedures. We then supplement these local outlets with
  articles from international and regional sources to ensure
  comprehensive coverage.
\item
  \textbf{URL Discovery:} Second, we identify urls for all articles
  published by a source by looking for a structured entry-point.
  Typically, this is a public sitemap. If the sitemap is incomplete or
  missing, we switch to site-specific search strategies (pagination
  through section indexes, keyword queries, RSS feeds, etc.). Only when
  those programmatic methods fail do we fall back on more intensive
  tools, such as simulated infinite clicking/scrolling with Selenium.
  Even in these cases, the goal is to retrieve clean article links, not
  to crawl arbitrary pages. In order to avoid storing the same article
  multiple times, we de-duplicate based on URL and title similarity for
  articles published in the same month.
\item
  \textbf{Develop Custom Scrapers and Parsers:} Next, we create tailored
  scrapers and parsers for each website's unique structure and
  publishing practices. These tools can bypass common barriers such as
  robot blockers (e.g., Cloudflare), which affect roughly 15\% of our
  sources. By designing source-specific scrapers, we minimize data loss
  and ensure accurate capture of critical metadata (e.g., publication
  date, author, section).
\item
  \textbf{Monitor and Update Quarterly:} Finally, we evaluate scraper
  and parser performance every 90 days, adapting to changes in website

\end{enumerate}

Appendix A provides comprehensive documentation of the media sources and
linguistic diversity underlying the \emph{HQMARC} corpus. Section 1
documents the geographic distribution of domestic and regional media
outlets across our sample, presenting visualizations of source counts by
country and temporal patterns of source activity over the 2012-2024
period. Section 2 catalogs the linguistic diversity of the corpus,
documenting the languages published by media outlets in each country
using ISO language codes. Section 3 provides the complete inventory of
digital news sources included in \emph{HQMARC} by country, offering full
transparency about the specific media outlets that comprise our dataset.

We validate our custom harvesting workflow by comparing \emph{HQMARC} to
large ``big-data'' corpora (e.g., GDELT, Internet Archive).
\emph{HQMARC} captures a far larger share of articles from leading
domestic outlets and avoids the parsing and metadata errors common to
generalized crawlers.

To demonstrate that relying on crawler-based big data archives results
in poor coverage from critical sources in developing countries we
compare \emph{HQMARC's} coverage of three prominent Bangladeshi news
outlets to that of GDELT and Internet Archive. We focused our case study
on Bangladesh for three reasons. First, Bangladeshi outlets publish a
high volume of articles relative to other countries, making them more
likely to attract and be captured by automated crawlers. Second, the
website architecture for each outlet is relatively straightforward,
maximizing the likelihood that crawlers, combined with generalized
scrapers and parsers, should be able to accurately retrieve articles.
Third, many Bangladeshi sources publish primarily in English, reducing
the additional hurdles of multilingual parsing. As a result, we regard
these outlets as a ``best-case scenario'' for large-scale media
repositories.

Despite favorable conditions, we find notable differences between the
results achieved by \emph{HQMARC's} curated approach and those of GDELT
and Internet Archive. \emph{HQMARC's} coverage begins in 2013 for one
source and in 2015 for the other two. However, GDELT does not have any
articles published before 2019 for any of the three sources. Even within
the overlapping years beginning 2019, GDELT captured many fewer articles
than \emph{HQMARC}. For the source with the smallest disparity between
\emph{HQMARC} and GDELT, GDELT retrieves an average of 2,100 articles
per month, compared to 2,500 in \emph{HQMARC}. GDELT also includes
numerous broken links, redirects, duplicate articles, and advertisements
that were flagged by \emph{HQMARC's} human review and removed. In
addition, GDELT enforces a five-second delay per query, making it
extremely time-consuming to scrape a full historical archive of this
size. Across these three sources, Internet Archive achieved coverage
similar to that of \emph{HQMARC}, but more than half of these urls were
broken and no longer pointed to the a webpage that contained the article
text. Furthermore, collecting URLs from Internet Archive for 2019--2023
required roughly two weeks from a single source and returned many
irrelevant and duplicate links not contained in \emph{HQMARC}.

Yet the advantages of \emph{HQMARC} extend beyond coverage. After
collecting URLs, reliable metadata extraction relies on generalized
scraping and parsing tools without human oversight. Figure
Figure~\ref{fig-true_false_spike} shows why that fails and why review
matters. When scraping articles without human oversight, we see a large
spike in the volume of articles being published by major outlets in
Ghana and Zambia. On the left, this spike captures a genuine increase in
articles published by \texttt{ghanaweb.com} (Ghana), which was triggered
by a grant from Google that enabled the outlet to expand its reporting
capacity. On the right, we see an artificial spike in the number of
articles published by \texttt{lusakatimes.com} (Zambia) driven by a
single article being hosted at more than 1.5 million \emph{unique} urls
on the source's website, making the duplication difficult to detect. In
both cases, we noticed a suspicions spike in publication volume and
investigated the cause. Our human-in-the-loop approach effectively
guards against such errors, enhancing the overall reliability and
quality of \emph{HQMARC}. Importantly, such errors can be caused by a
wide range of scraping and parsing failures, including dates that are
incorrectly formatted or incorrect dates or other tags accidentally
embedded in an articles html.

\caption{\label{fig-true_false_spike}Changes in the volume of articles

article duplicated hundreds of thousands of times.}

\subsection{Capturing Civic Space Events in
ML4P}\label{capturing-civic-space-events-in-ml4p}}

To generate the \emph{ML4P} civic-space event data, we use open-source
tools to extract and classify article text from the \emph{HQMARC}
corpus. The pipeline translates articles, identifies primary locations,
classifies events, screens for political relevance, measures
country-month salience, and flags months of heightened activity across
event types.

\hypertarget{translating-non-english-text}{%
\subsubsection{Translating Non-English
Text}\label{translating-non-english-text}}

It is well-documented that reporting by international and regional media
outlets on political events in developing countries contains significant
biases that can affect data quality (Baum and Zhukov 2015), even when
covering relatively uncontroversial topics like natural disasters
(Brimicombe 2022). To address this, \emph{HQMARC} focuses on collecting
data from a curated list 354 prominent \emph{domestic} media outlets
publishing in 36 languages. In fact, more than 95\% of the articles in
\emph{HQMARC} are scraped from domestic media outlets based in the
countries covered by our dataset.

After scraping each article, we translate the first 600 characters of
all non-English texts into English using neural machine translations
(NMT) through Hugging Face or OpenNMT.\footnote{While multilingual
  transformer models capable of classifying events directly in multiple
  languages exist, these models are not currently able to support the
  diversity of languages present in \emph{HQMARC}. However, once more
  capable open-source models become available, \emph{ML4P's} flexible
  infrastructure will allow us to quickly apply these models to the
  entire \emph{HQMARC} corpus.}. For each language, we test available
models on sample text and select the one with the clearest translation
output for event identification. If multiple models produce satisfactory
results, we select the model that yields the clearest
sentence-to-sentence translations, cross-checking against Google
Translate to detect any loss of contextual detail. In rare cases, we
test commercial translation services accessible through the
\texttt{deep-translator} Python package. For every language in our
corpus, we identified models that produce translations clear enough for
humans and our classifier to recover the primary event\footnote{Tetum is
  the only language for which we could not initially find an acceptable
  translation model. After waiting several months, an open-source model
  became available.}.

\hypertarget{identifying-locations}{%
\subsubsection{Identifying Locations}\label{identifying-locations}}

Both international and domestic outlets report on events taking place
across a broad range of countries. To ensure that the events we capture
events in the country of interest, we identify all locations mentioned
in the first 600 characters of text. If no country is found in the text,
we assign the article to the country in which the publishing outlet is
based. For international and regional outlets, articles are only
assigned to a country if they explicitly mention a location within that
country in the first 600 characters.

To locate events and identify those happening within a target country,
we use the CLIFF-CLAVIN geoparser\footnote{For technical details on
  CLIFF, see: \href{https://github.com/mediacloud/cliff-annotator}{CLIFF
  Annotator}} with the GeoNames ontological gazetteer to identify
geographic entities (e.g., states, cities, towns) mentioned in the text.
CLIFF-CLAVIN integrates the \href{https://www.geonames.org/}{GeoNames}
database, which is a free, online directory containing over 12 million
place names across 250 countries (D'Ignazio et al. 2014). GeoNames is
one of the most comprehensive and actively maintained sources of
geographic data, making it an ideal reference for matching entity
mentions to specific global coordinates. For each location, we use the
CLIFF API to retrieve the location's country code and assign the article
to that country. We implement several corrections to the underlying
CLIFF system, including overriding an error that assigns mentions of
\enquote{West Africa} to Angola and the assignment of \enquote{Gaza} to
locations named \enquote{Ghaza} in Algeria and Pakistan.

\hypertarget{classifying-civic-space-events}{%
\subsubsection{Classifying Civic Space
Events}\label{classifying-civic-space-events}}

To identify articles reporting on one of our 20 civic space event
categories, we fine-tuned an open source, transformer-based RoBERTa
language model (Liu et al.
2019).\footnote{Recent research has shown that costly, closed-source LLMs only perform moderately better at even complicated tasks relative to models like RoBERTa, and usually require more costly fine-tuning [@deandrade2024]. Moreover, RoBERTa performs well for most common applications in Political Science [@timoneda2024roberta].}
To fine-tune the model, we constructed a double human-coded training
dataset consisting of 6,475 newspaper articles (4,982 reporting on one
of our 20 events and 1,493 reporting on irrelevant events) originally
published in both English and non-English languages. As reported in
Table~\ref{tbl-roberta} average out-of-sample classification accuracy is
82\%,\footnote{This is comparable to intercoder reliability. During model training, we adopted an iterative approach: after each training round, we gathered new examples for categories with lower accuracy, retrained the model, and repeated until performance stabilized.}
with many misses coming from the presence of multiple events in a single
article or from partially overlapping event categories. Column-specific
metrics (precision, recall, F1) are provided for each event category.
See Appendix B Section 1 for a definition and examples for each event
category. To reduce noise associated with background and contextual
content, we apply this classification to the article title and first 600
characters of main
text.\footnote{Typically, this corresponds to the article title plus the first 2-3 sentences of text. Extensive testing suggests that providing addition text from articles decreases classifier performance by including irrelevant contextual information that reduces the model's ability to identify the main event.}

\end{longtable}

To address articles containing multiple overlapping events, we permit
dual classifications for a small number of event types. For example,
events such as corruption often occur concurrently with arrests or legal
proceedings. For several categories, we further apply a targeted keyword
filter to eliminate common false-positives. See Appendix B Section 2 for
a description of keyword filtering used during classification.

\hypertarget{distinguishing-politically-relevant-events}{%
\subsubsection{Distinguishing Politically Relevant
Events}\label{distinguishing-politically-relevant-events}}

In addition to our event classification model, we deploy an additional
classifier to exclude articles reporting on events that match one of our
event categories but are not politically or socially relevant. For
example, our `Arrest' category seeks to identify politically relevant
arrests, such as the arrest of a politically relevant figure. However,
our first model also classifies articles reporting on arrests for
apolitical criminal activity that do not meet our category definition.
We built this political relevance classifier using transfer learning
from our fine-tuned RoBERTa model and fine-tuned it using a double
human-coded training dataset of 2,938 articles; the model achieves an
overall accuracy of 0.87. For each article the main classifier flags as
an event, this secondary model provides a binary (0/1) output indicating
its civic relevance.

\hypertarget{measuring-event-salience}{%
\subsubsection{Measuring Event
Salience}\label{measuring-event-salience}}

Finally, we aggregate these data to the country-month level, normalizing
the count of articles reporting on each event by the total number of
articles published in that country-month. The final \emph{ML4P} measures
correspond to the monthly share of all news reporting on a country that
cover each \emph{ML4P} event category. Importantly, this is made
possible by \emph{HQMARC's} custom scraping to capture outlets' full
publication history, which allows us to measure the true number of
articles published by each source. This ratio tells us how frequently
each \emph{ML4P} event type is reported on relative to the total volume
of news in a given month. While this method does not directly code
individual \emph{ML4P} events, since important events receive coverage
in many articles, it does provide information on the \emph{relative
importance} of each event-category in a given month. This approach also
enhances the ability to assess trends over time by avoiding the risk
that increases or decreases in our raw event counts are artifacts of
changes in the volume of overall reporting driven by sources entering or
leaving the \emph{HQMARC} database or changes in the publication volume
of sources over time (ACLED 2023).

\hypertarget{detecting-major-event-shocks}{%
\subsubsection{Detecting Major Event
Shocks}\label{detecting-major-event-shocks}}

We supplement the measures described above by identifying months in
which major civic space events occurred. To detect months with major
events, we developed an ensemble algorithm to detect sharp increases in
the share of reporting dedicated to each event category. We refer to
these sharp increases as \emph{shocks}.

Our approach begins with winsorization of the data, which curbs the
influence of extreme outliers by replacing values beyond a specified
percentile threshold with the nearest boundary value. Next, we apply a
25-month rolling window to smooth the normalized event counts and
perform a grid search to tune various parameters. These include the
multipliers for weighted means and weighted standard deviations, as well
as the binning weights and decay functions that govern how observations
in the window are weighted. To capture shocks accurately, we employ two
distinct weighting schemes for the historical (left-hand side, LHS) and
future (right-hand side, RHS) segments of the rolling window. For the
LHS window, we use a non-linear decay weighting that places
progressively less emphasis on more distant historical months, enabling
the detection of rapid changes in recent data. For the RHS window, we
apply binning weights that decay linearly over time, preventing
overestimation of peaks when the underlying data structure shifts.
Combining winsorization with context-sensitive decay and binning weights
enables monthly detection of significant increases in each civic space
event type.

Next, we trained a neural network model to detect spikes in a
human-labeled dataset covering the full time-series for 30 country-event
pairs. We conducted human-labeling by asking humans to identify months
with visually distinct, sharp increases in our event measures. Human
labelers were instructed to identify no more than 15\% of overall months
as shocks, ensuring that peaks are not overly frequent in highly
variable data while still capturing meaningful shifts in lower-variance
event types. When either the statistical or neural network model detect
a shock, we label that month as a shock in the data.

\hypertarget{sec-validation}{%
\section{4. Data Description and Validation}\label{sec-validation}}

In this section, we present the data, show the importance of
\emph{HQMARC's} reliance on domestic news sources for a rich portrayal
of civic activity in countries, and results from two data validation
exercises. Figure~\ref{fig-map_cs_p_main} and
Figure~\ref{fig-map_main_event} show cross-national variation in the
data across four annual snapshots. Figure~\ref{fig-map_cs_p_main}
measures the share of all articles classified as one of our 20 civic
space events across four years. For example, the share of Ukraine's
coverage dedicated to civic space events jumped from 10\% in 2012 to
30\% in 2024, . Complementing this, Figure~\ref{fig-map_main_event}
examines the most frequently reported-on civic space event type across
countries. Several temporal shifts are evident: in 2020, Natural
Disasters dominated coverage in most coverage, driven by coverage of
COVID-19, while in 2024, several countries with high-profile national
elections see Election Activity coverage dominate. Maps showing annual
averages for all years in the data appear in Appendix C.

\hypertarget{comparing-international-and-local-media}{%
\subsection{Comparing International and Local
Media}\label{comparing-international-and-local-media}}

While the previous section demonstrates how \emph{ML4P} provides data on
civic space dynamics, we now show that this data relies heavily on the
domestic sources targeted by \emph{HQMARC}. Compare domestic and
international news coverage of civic space events across our sample of
developing countries, we demonstrate that relying solely on
international media often yields an incomplete and likely biased view of
civic space.

For all articles in \emph{HQMARC} reporting on a each event category,
Figure~\ref{fig-int_share_norm} presents the proportion of those
articles coming from domestic versus international sources averaging
across countries in our sample. The stacked bars show the percentage of
total articles about each civic event type that come from domestic
(blue) versus international (green) sources; for most event types,
domestic sources provide well over 80\% of the data and in many specific
countries, the share is much higher. The red points label the
correlation coefficient between domestic and international reporting for
each civic space event category in countries and over time. If domestic
and international sources were covering the same events at the same
times, there would be a high correlation between them. Yet the
correlation in reporting is consistently weak or moderate across our 20
event categories. Furthermore, this correlation is not consistently
higher for categories that receive more international attention, such as
Lethal Violence and Security Raids.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{source_comparison/figures/int_share_norm.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-int_share_norm}Proportional distribution of civic
event coverage between domestic and international sources. Stacked bars
show the percentage of total articles about each civic event type that
come from domestic (blue) versus international (green) sources. Events
are ordered by correlation strength between domestic and international
coverage (red points labeled with correlation coefficient). Domestic and
international sources show weak correlations in their coverage patterns,
regardless of the share of articles coming from international sources.
Example: Of all Arrest articles, 83\% come from domestic sources and
17\% from international sources. The correlation between domestic and
international reporting on arrests is 0.17.}

\end{figure}

This correlation in coverage between international and domestic sources
does increase as countries receive more international media attention.
Rather than reporting the average correlation within event categories
across countries, Figure~\ref{fig-int_nat_corr_by_country} shows the
correlation within countries and across event categories.
Figure~\ref{fig-int_nat_corr_by_country} plots a country's volume of
international articles (x-axis) against the correlation in civic space
event coverage between international and national sources (y-axis).
Although the correlation increases substantially for countries that
receive more iternational coverage, the correlation remains low in
nearly all cases. For example, Turkey and India receive substantial
international attention yet exhibit domestic-international correlation
values below 0.5.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{source_comparison/figures/int_nat_corr_by_country.png}

\caption{\label{fig-int_nat_corr_by_country}Relationship between

log scale). Countries with higher international media attention tend to
show stronger positive correlations between domestic and international
coverage patterns, suggesting that sustained international focus may
lead to more synchronized reporting priorities. Selected countries are
labeled to illustrate this pattern: Ukraine, Turkey, and India (high
international attention, strong positive correlation) versus Timor Leste
and Jamaica (low international attention, weak correlation). Even for
high-attention countries, this correlation is surprisingly weak.}

\end{figure}

We see similar variation when considering where international and
domestic outlets focus their attention.
Figure~\ref{fig-event_share_total} investigates how intensely domestic
and international sources focus on each event category. Overlapping bars
show the rate at which each source type covers different civic events
(expressed as articles per 10,000 total articles). Consistently higher
bars for international sources suggest that international sources devote
a larger share of their total articles to civic space events, relative
to domestic outlets, whose coverage includes a greater share of articles
reporting on events that do not fall into one of our 20 event
categories. This is not surprising since domestic sources often cover
issues of social and cultural import in addition to `hard' news. We also
see, however, that domestic and international sources differ in their
relative focus on different civic space events. For instance, while
international sources exhibit higher relative focus on Lethal and
Non-lethal Violence, domestic sources exhibit higher relative focus on
event types like Election Activity and Corruption. These patterns
reflect different editorial priorities of international versus domestic
media.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{source_comparison/figures/event_share_total.png}

\caption{\label{fig-event_share_total}Frequency of civic event coverage

highest). International sources (green) show more intense focus across
all civic event types, suggesting their International sources exhibit
higher relative focus on Lethal and Non-lethal Violence, while domestic
sources (blue) exhibit higher relative focus on Election Activity. These
patterns reflect different editorial priorities of international versus
domestic media. Data normalized by total articles within each source
type per country-month. Example: Domestic sources publish 65 lethal
violence articles per 10,000 articles, while international sources
publish 326 lethal violence articles per 10,000 articles.}

\end{figure}

We illustrate the broader point with a case study of reporting on
corruption in Indonesia. Between March and November, a series of major
corruption scandals broke out, including the PT Timah state enterprise
corruption case in March, the Tom Lembong sugar import case and the
Sahbirin Noor South Kalimantan Governor case in October, and the Rohidin
Mersyah electoral case in November. In May 2024 alone, domestic outlets
published over 970 articles covering corruption revelations and 107
articles covering political arrests, many related to the PT Timah state
enterprise case. Despite the gravity of these events, our regional and
international sources carried \emph{zero} relevant articles. This
discrepancy suggests that a reliance on international sources not only
provides an incomplete view of the salience of different events in many
country's domestic political environments, but may even entirely
overlook key events. Across our dataset, we identified 59 cases across
23 countries where we detected large civic `shocks' but found zero
articles published in regional or international sources.

\hypertarget{major-event-validation}{%
\subsection{Major Event Validation}\label{major-event-validation}}

To validate the ability of our data to detect major political events, we
adopt two approaches. First, focusing on months designated by our model
as containing major events (shocks), we examine whether observed spikes
in coverage correspond to real-world developments (i.e.~true positives).
We randomly selected five countries from our database---Kosovo, Morocco,
Angola, Mauritania, and Ukraine---which together span three regions
(North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe) and four
languages (Serbian, Albanian, French, and Ukrainian). Focusing on the
three most recent months of data available at the time of the analysis
(April--June 2024), there were 300 total possible event-months (3 months
× 5 countries × 20 events) that our shock detection model could have
detected. Of these 300 possible event-months, our model flagged 40 as
exhibiting a shocks.

For each of the 40 country-event-month combinations, we retrieve all
relevant articles published by domestic outlets in the \emph{HQMARC}
corpus to determine whether these shocks are true or false positives.
Because some of these 40 country-event-months with shocks contained
hundreds of articles,\footnote{Across detected events, the number of
  relevant domestic articles ranged from 1 to 1,002. For rare event
  categories (e.g., \emph{Defamation Case}), a single article can define
  an event.} we used GPT-4o\footnote{The full GPT-4o prompts, GPT-4o
  generated summaries, human-coding instructions, and validation results
  can be found in the \texttt{shock-validation} subfolder of the Git
  repository. GPT-4o was accessed through the OpenAI API.} to generate
brief summaries of the five most important events reported on in the
sample of articles. A research assistant then reviewed both (a) the
original articles (or a random subset of 50, if more than 50 were
available) and (b) the GPT-4o summaries. They evaluated each of the top
five summarized events on four dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How many summarized events are accurately described by GPT-4o (i.e.,
  factually correct)?
\item
  How many summarized events are indeed the most important events,
  according to the underlying articles?
\item
  How many occurred in the assigned country?
\item
  How many match the assigned event category?
\end{itemize}

In 34 out of 40 country-months (85\%), \emph{all} top-five events
identified by GPT-4o occurred in the correct country, and in 38 out of
40 (95\%), \emph{all} top-five events belonged to the correct event
category. Overall, out of 200 summarized events, 181 were true
positives. These findings strongly suggest that our measure reliably
detects months with major political developments.

Our second approach begins by identifying major events in the world that
we would expect to generate measurable shocks in the \emph{ML4P} data
and assessing whether these events are captured as shocks in the data
(avoiding false negatives). We apply this approach in three ways: (1)
identifying a single historical event likely to generate media attention
on one of our \emph{ML4P} event categories across multiple countries,
(2) assessing our ability to detect both frequent and rare political
events through spikes in relevant \emph{ML4P} event categories, and (3)
analyzing events within a single country that are expected to trigger
shocks across multiple \emph{ML4P} event categories.

We first examine the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and government
responses to it, particularly the widespread implementation of social
confinement measures, such as lockdowns. These measures often included
school closures, curfews, and restrictions on non-essential businesses
and government services (Cheng et al. 2020). These lockdown measures
should be associated with shocks in the State of Emergency event
category. As shown in Appendix D, we detect shocks in State of Emergency
counts across all countries in our dataset starting in March 2020.

Next, we analyze the detection of key political events across multiple
countries, focusing on a relatively frequent event---elections and
electoral activities---and a rare event---coup d'état. To do so, we
identify the most recent electoral event (e.g., general, parliamentary,
or presidential election) for each country in our dataset.
Figure~\ref{fig-elections_lac} demonstrates that our shock detection
models detect periods of heightened electoral activity in the months
immediately preceding these elections in all 10 Latin American and
Caribbean countries we examined. Notably, our approach also detects
electoral activity in electoral autocracies, such as Nicaragua under
Daniel Ortega (Thaler and Mosinger 2022), highlighting its ability to
track political events across different regime types.

\end{figure}

We now focus our attention on coups d'état. We identify all nine
countries in our sample---Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger,
Peru, Tunisia, Turkey, and Zimbabwe---where a coup or self-coup was
attempted or succeeded in the past decade. We then assess whether these
events correspond to shocks in the Irregular Transition event category.
As Figure~\ref{fig-coups_9} illustrates, all 14 successful or attempted
coups and self-coups across these nine countries are associated with a
shock in the Irregular Transition event measure.

Successful). Notes: The vertical lines in each panel indicate the month

each country.}

\end{figure}

Finally, we examine events expected to generate shocks in multiple event
categories. We focus on the 2023 Guatemalan general elections, where
opposition candidate Bernardo Arévalo and his party, \emph{Movimiento
Semilla}, secured a surprise victory despite institutional attempts to
undermine their candidacy. The electoral period ran from January to
August 2023, concluding with the run-off election. As expected, the
upper-left panel of Figure~\ref{fig-gt_2023} shows that our shock
detection model identifies a shock in the Election Activity measure
during this period. Efforts to disqualify Arévalo intensified between
the first-round election on June 25 and the run-off on August 20,
followed immediately by attempts to prevent him from taking office once
the vote count was finalized. The upper-right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig-gt_2023} captures these attempts, detecting shocks in
Election Irregularities between the general and run-off elections, as
well as in the post-election period leading up to the inauguration.

\begin{figure}

in January 2023 and concluding with the presidential inauguration in
January 2024. The general elections were held in June 2023, followed by
the presidential runoff in August 2023.}

\end{figure}

The lower-left panel of Figure~\ref{fig-gt_2023} provides further
validation of \emph{ML4P's} ability to capture critical events in
Guatemala's political history. Between the run-off and the inauguration,
we detect a shock to reporting on Legal Actions in September,
corresponding with the Public Prosecutor's direct efforts to nullify the
election results, and again in December 2023, when the Organization of
American States (OAS) officially condemned the ongoing and intensifying
power grab.\footnote{The press release by the OAS can be found here:
  \url{https://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-084/23}}
Finally, the lower-right panel of Figure~\ref{fig-gt_2023} shows that we
detect a shock in reporting on the massive protests that broke-out in
October, led by indigenous groups and civil society organizations
demanding the resignation of the Public Prosecutor and a peaceful
transfer of power. Researchers have identified this civil society
mobilization as a key factor in ensuring the eventual transfer of power
(Schwartz and Isaacs 2023; Meléndez-Sánchez and Gamboa 2023; Romero
2024). Overall, this case provides compelling evidence of \emph{ML4P'}s
ability to capture the fast-paced civic space events underlying an
attempted--and failed--autocratic turn in Guatemala.

\section{5. Use Case: Forecasting Travel Advisory Onsets with
ML4P}\label{sec-usecase}}

In this section, we demonstrate that \emph{ML4P's} ability to capture
dynamic civic space dynamics contributes in a substantively important
forecasting application. That high-frequency civic space indicators help
predict the issuance of independent security assessments---U.S.
Department of State (DOS) high-level travel advisories
(HLTAs)---provides de facto validation that MLP's data captures
meaningful underlying political conditions.

We construct a monthly panel dataset covering 60 developing countries
from 2012 to 2023 and model the onset of Level 3 (``Reconsider Travel'')
and Level 4 (``Do Not Travel'') travel advisories. These advisories
serve as official DOS risk assessments and capture a diverse array of
threats, including civil unrest, political repression, armed conflict,
health emergencies, natural disasters, and crime waves. Beyond their
significance as public warnings, these advisories drive critical
operational responses, including embassy closures, staff relocations,
and security escalations. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to
evaluate whether high-frequency civic space indicators contain
predictive signals of future security threats.

Although DOS issues advisories in real time, its historical archives are
not systematically structured, thus complicating retrospective analysis.
We reconstructed the series by scraping DOS pages and filling gaps with
the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org).We defined a binary onset
indicator equal to 1 in the first country--month an advisory appears and
0 thereafter (i.e.~we are not predicting ongoing travel advisories).

To forecast HLTA onsets, we incorporate monthly event counts from MLP
across 20 political event categories, including protests, arrests of
activists, media censorship, election irregularities, and emergency
declarations. We also include a composite economic covariate calculated
as a within-country z-score of available monthly Trading Economics
indicators for each country. Given the importance of both gradual and
sudden shifts in political conditions, we lag all features by up to 12
months, allowing the model to detect both long-term precursors (such as
increasing government repression) and short-term triggers (such as
post-election violence). We account for persistence by including an
indicator distinguishing between new HLTA onsets and continued warnings,
a country-specific Bayesian prior that adjusts for baseline differences
in advisory issuance, and a COVID-19 indicator to control for the
pandemic-driven shock in travel warnings in 2020.

HLTA onsets occur in only 1.42\% of country-months; as a
rar\footnote{For consistency over time, we include all advisories before
  2018 and Levels 3-4 after the introduction for the four-level system
  in 2018. Consultation with DOS consular staff suggests that all
  pre-2018 advisories align closely with post-2018 Levels 3-4 in
  severity.}e-event it is a challenging forecasting target. We train a
LightGBM gradient-boosted tree model, which effectively handles class
imbalance while capturing nonlinear interactions among political
variables, and provide forecasts for 3- and 6-month horizons. To ensure
that the model generalizes to unseen time periods, we implement
rolling-origin temporor cross-validation, strictly limiting training
data to historical observations and preventing information leakage
(Rodolfa, Lamba, and Ghani 2021).\footnote{See Soltani, Springman and
  Wibbels (2025) for further details on the data and models.} We
evaluate model performance using ROC-AUC, which measures ranking
accuracy; AUPRC, which assesses precision-recall tradeoffs for
rare-event classification; and the Brier score, which quantifies
probability calibration.

Our models strongly predict HLTA issuance, confirming that MLP's event
data captures meaningful geopolitical risk indicators. For the 3-month
prediction horizon, our model achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.87, AUC-PR of
0.26, and a Brier score of 0.14, compared to a dummy AUC-PR of 0.01.
When we apply a rolling-window evaluation, where we count predictions as
correct if an onset occurs within ±1 month of the forecast, the
performance improves to a ROC-AUC of 0.89, AUC-PR of 0.54, and Brier
score of 0.12, with a slightly higher dummy AUC-PR of 0.02. For the
6-month horizon, our model yields a ROC-AUC of 0.87, AUC-PR of 0.31, and
a Brier score of 0.14 (dummy AUC-PR = 0.01), while the rolling-window
variant (±1 month) increases ROC-AUC to 0.90, AUC-PR to 0.57, and lowers
the Brier score to 0.13, again with a dummy AUC-PR of 0.02.\footnote{Following
  Brechenmacher and Carothers (2019), we define civic space as the
  fundamental freedoms that allow people to gather, communicate, and
  take part in groups to influence society and politics.}2

Feature importance analysis shows that for 3-month forecasts, recent
declarations of martial law, especially those within the past two
months, are the strongest predictors of HLTA onsets Other influential
short-horizon predictors include prior travel advisory levels, protest
activity, natural disasters, and election irregularities. For 6-month
forecasts, the most predictive variable is election-related activity
occurring 11 months before an onset, followed by martial law
declarations, censorship, and disaster events. Additional medium-horizon
predictors include measures of government cooperation, arrests, and
legal changes. These patterns suggest that while immediate security
measures and unrest drive short-term risk, longer-horizon forecasts are
shaped more by political processes, governance shifts, and gradual
escalations in repression or instability.

\hypertarget{sec-limitations}{%
\section{6. Limitations and Cautions}\label{sec-limitations}}

Although \emph{HQMARC's} ``medium-data'' approach gives a much more
reliable representation of domestic media markets, it has several
limitations. First, courtesy of uneven archiving practices by media
outlets, stories from more recent years are easier to collect than older
stories. Thus, the total number of stories tends to trend up over time.
Focusing on event salience, rather than the raw number of articles
reporting on each event type, attempts to mitigate the influence of
these trends on our measures of civic space activity.

Second, domestic sources that are more difficult to scrape are less
likely to be included. Some high-quality sources in low-resource
countries have extremely poor website architecture, making them
extremely difficult to collect data from. Third, news organizations have
their own biases. For example, their coverage is much stronger in cities
than in more rural areas. Despite these limitations, \emph{HQMARC's}
focus on domestic media paints a much richer picture than the even more
biased view provided by international media of these countries.

Two cautions arise from \emph{ML4P's} reliance on media attention as a
proxy for the importance of an event. First, media coverage is obviously
influenced by editorial priorities, political pressures, and audience
interests rather than any objective significance of an event. Some
critical events may receive limited coverage due to competing news
cycles, censorship, or media ownership structures, leading to
under-representation in our dataset. Conversely, sensational or
high-profile stories might be disproportionately amplified, skewing the
perceived relevance of events in ways that do not necessarily reflect
their actual impact. Second, our normalization approach (dividing event
counts by total coverage), forces competition between different event
categories within any given month. As coverage of some event types go
up, others necessarily go down. When an exceptionally large event
dominates media coverage---e.g., a major political crisis or a natural
disaster---other significant, but less dramatic, events will appear
relatively less important in our data.

\hypertarget{sec-conclusion}{%
\section{7. Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}}

As democratic institutions face unprecedented challenges in the current
era of autocratization, understanding the day-to-day dynamics of civic
space has become critical for both academic research and policy
intervention. This paper addresses a fundamental gap in our ability to
study these dynamics by introducing the \emph{ML4P} dataset---the first
comprehensive, high-frequency measure of civic space events across
developing countries.

Our contribution is both empirical and methodological. Empirically,
\emph{ML4P} provides monthly data on 20 civic space events across a
large sample of developing countries from 2012 to 2024, constructed from
over 120 million articles published by 354 hand-picked domestic media
outlets publishing in 36 languages. This represents an unprecedented
scale of coverage for civic space monitoring, with 95\% of articles
sourced from domestic rather than international outlets.
Methodologically, we demonstrate that combining human-supervised web
scraping with open-source transformer models can achieve both
comprehensive coverage and high classification accuracy while
maintaining cost-effectiveness and transparency.

Our validation exercises confirm that \emph{ML4P} successfully captures
real-world political dynamics, from COVID-19 lockdowns and electoral
cycles to coups and democratic crises. Critically, we document
systematic biases in international media coverage, finding that
international sources exhibit weak correlation with domestic reporting
and entirely miss major events. These findings have profound
implications for existing event datasets that rely heavily on
international sources. The predictive utility of our data is
demonstrated through our travel advisory forecasting model. This
validates that \emph{ML4P} captures meaningful early warning signals of
political instability rather than mere reporting artifacts.

This work opens several important avenues for future research. First,
\emph{ML4P} enables new studies of democratic backsliding mechanisms by
providing the temporal granularity necessary to trace how specific
events contribute to broader regime changes. Second, the dataset
facilitates research on contentious politics, media behavior under
authoritarianism, and the effectiveness of democracy support programs.

For policymakers, our findings underscore the critical importance of
incorporating domestic media perspectives into intelligence and
assessment processes. The systematic differences we document between
international and domestic coverage suggest that relying on
international sources alone can lead to fundamental misunderstandings of
political conditions on the ground. Investment in human-supervised data
collection infrastructures, as demonstrated by \emph{HQMARC}, represents
a crucial complement to automated systems.

Future research should expand \emph{ML4P's} geographic coverage and
integrate \emph{ML4P} with other high-frequency political indicators
could enhance our understanding of how civic space dynamics interact
with economic conditions, social movements, and international
interventions. \emph{ML4P} represents more than a new dataset---it
provides a new lens for understanding how democracy erodes and civic
space contracts in real time. As authoritarian movements continue to
challenge democratic institutions worldwide, tools like \emph{ML4P}
become essential for both documenting these processes and developing
effective responses to defend civic space and democratic governance.
